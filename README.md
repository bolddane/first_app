# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: first application

This is the first application for the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

Change #1: modify the README.md file so that I can record github changes for APIs that are monitoring these changes.

Change #2: modify README.md with this comment, made on the bold/feature_1 branch.  I will later create a new branch from this branch, named bold/feature_1_delta, and I'll used that to commit changes that are later committed back to bold/feature_1, but *not* back to master.
