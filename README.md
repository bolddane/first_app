# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: first application

This is the first application for the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

Change #1: modify the README.md file so that I can record github changes for APIs that are monitoring these changes.
