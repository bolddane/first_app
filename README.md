# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: first application

This is the first application for the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

Change #1: modify the README.md file so that I can record github changes for APIs that are monitoring these changes.

Change #2: modify README.md with this comment, made on the bold/feature_1 branch.  I will later create a new branch from this branch, named bold/feature_1_delta, and I'll used that to commit changes that are later committed back to bold/feature_1, but *not* back to master.

Change #3: modify README.md again, with this comment, made on bold/feature_1_delta.  This change will be comitted locally and push to GH.  I will then create a PR between bold/feature_1_delta and bold/feature_1.

Change #4: test embedding an *asterisk* in a code block:

```
dist/* -diff
```

 Will this show up correctly?
